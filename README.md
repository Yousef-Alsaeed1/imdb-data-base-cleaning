# IMDb Data Cleaning Project


This repo contains Python  scripts to clean selected IMDb datasets using pandas

# What I have done so far
- Cleaned 'title.basics.tsv.gz' to extract movies & TV titles
- Produced 'titles_clean.csv' and 'title_genres_clean.csv'
- Removed unnecessary columns to focus on relevant data for database design.




## Project Background

At the beginning this project was intended to be a **database design exercise** to test my SQL skills.

However i realized that the raw IMDb data required data cleaning and preprocessing first.

This led the project to naturally evolve into a data cleaning workflow.


## Next Steps
- Clean additional IMDb datasets ('name.basics.tsv.gz', 'title.ratings.tsv.gz', etc).
- Use the cleaned data to design a relational database.
